# dev-proxy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mrotaru/dev-proxy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mrotaru/dev-proxy)

Proxy for use in front-end development. Primarily intended for situations where
the backend API is unreliable. In this case, it will serve cached responses.
That's the plan, at least; functionality isn't there yet.
